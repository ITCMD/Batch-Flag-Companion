# Batch Flag Companion

Allows you to run through an unlimited number of flags with / or - as the preamble. Then, allows you to run a command, set a variable, or call a function with an easy to use script without worrying about interrupting other functions. Order doesnt matter (except for commands) but even with commands, you can delay the command to run after everything else if you wish!

Check out the WITH EXAMPLES script to learn how to use it.

To add it to your script, simply paste it at the ***top*** of your file.
